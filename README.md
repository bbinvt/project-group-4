# Data description and why we select it?

# List of Technologies Used
- Python
- SQL
- Tableau
- AWS

# Cleaning the Data Set
- Drop null values
- Drop columns: Critic Count, User Count, Developer, Rating (Alternatively try filling in null values with averages of the column)
- Normalize critic score and user score
- Weighted average of Revenues per year for direct comparisons between games - ie 50% (arbitrary) of revenue comes within the first year


# Potential analysis
- Best selling genre by market
- User/critic score by games/genres
